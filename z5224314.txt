Week 1
We formed our project group, and together decided to work on project 7 (E-commerce website).

Week 2
We decided to build a website to sell second hand textbooks to UNSW students. We started working on our proposal and came up with the epic section.

Week 3
We finalized our project proposal. I edited some user stories in the epic section to fit the final proposal. I also created an ER diagram for the proposal.
